## Description
  This server side API allows users on a social network site to do the following things:
    - Create an account as well as update it and delete it
    - Allows users to add other users to their list of friend and allows for them to be removed
    - Allows users to create, update, and delete thoughts
    - Allows users to react to thoughts as well as delete their reactions

## Usage
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
Since this Social Network API is server side only, you can view the routes being tested in insomnia in this video:

## Contributions
  As this is only the server side API for a social network app, this project can be contributed to by creating a front end for a social media site where the routes are intergrated into user actions on the front end.
